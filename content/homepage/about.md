I have recently started a *PhD* at <a href="https://www.rasmuspagh.net/providentia/">Providentia</a> at <a href="https://barc.ku.dk/">BARC</a> at the *University of Copenhagen* under the supervision of <a href="https://rasmuspagh.net/">*Rasmus Pagh*</a>.
My research area is that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy">Differential Privacy</a>.

Prior, I have been working as a _PLM consultant_ for _Atos_ in my vibrant home city Munich. 
During this time, I had the opportunity to contribute my expertise to a variety of international projects in the manufacturing and automotive industries where I led the design and implementation of innovative solutions utilizing the PLM suite *Siemens Teamcenter*.
I am proficient with a broad range of technologies and tools, including **Java** with the *Spring Framework*, **AngularJS**, **Siemens Teamcenter**, and **Docker**. 
Furthermore, I supported various tender offerings from a technical side and gained a lot of experience in supervising interns.
For a detailed overview of my projects, have a look at my <a href="docs/main.pdf">CV</a>.
I am a strong advocate of <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">agile</a> methodologies like <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrum-module">Scrum</a>.

In my spare time, you can find me either playing (beach) volleyball or sitting in front of my piano playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqx7eFpJ1co">sonatas</a>.
