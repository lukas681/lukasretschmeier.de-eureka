From 2015 to 2018, I have been working as a **PLM consultant** for *Atos* in Munich. While working on various projects in the manufacturing and automotive branch, I was leading the solution design and implementation of solutions around the PLM suite *Siemens Teamcenter*.
My skill set ranges from *Teamcenter* configuration and customization to the development of standalone tools using a wide variety of different technologies, but I mainly worked with **Java** (*Spring Framework*) and **AngularJS**.
