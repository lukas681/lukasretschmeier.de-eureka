# Tools I Currently Use

These are my tools I have in daily (academic) usage.
I mostly try to use native applications because of their nice synchronziation across all other devices.

**Note Taking**
I mostly use **Apple Notes** for digital notetaking.
But occasionally, I need something more powerful which is when I will use **GoodNotes** and **Obsidian**.

**News and Literture Research**

* **Zotero** incl. WebDAV file synch to private **Nextcloud** and _Zotero Cloud_ and **Chrome Connector**. Also, very nice for reading papers.
* **Google Scholar Plugin** for Chrome because of nice reference previews.
* **NetNewsWire**: My RSS Feed Reader with iCloud synch.
 Really helps to stay up-to-date in all different areas of interest. 
 RSS feeds even exist for daily arXiv submissions in chosen areas.

**Visualizations**

* **Apple Keynote** (because of native Latex support) for _presentations_ and _posters_.
* **Inkscape** for vector graphic modifications.
* **TikZ** with **tikzit**.
* **Excalidraw** (math preview) for technical /architectural sketches preferred over tikz.
* _Furthermore_: **Geogebra** for plots and **mathcha** for even more math that needs to be written down to tikz.

**Software Development**
* Enjoying the full **JetBrain** Suite (_IntelliJ_ , _DataSpell_, _clion_, ... ).
* Code Editing via **VS Code** / vim bindings / Plugins for whatever is currently needed.
* **Proxyman** and **Postman**.
* Environmental tools: **VirtualBox** (WIN)/**UTM** (MAC) \& **Docker** \& **WSL2** (if on WIN systems) 

**Misc**
* Task Management \& Canban Board: **Apple Reminders**
* Mail + Calendar: **Outlook**
* Webpages: Mostly powered by static-page generator **Hugo** and hosted (for free) with **Netlify** + custom **Github** commit triggers.
* Password Management: **KeePassX**, but being slowly replaced by **Apple Passwords**
* **Grammarly** for spell-and grammar checking.
* **iTerm** + **zsh** as default terminal.
* **Raycast** as a replacement of the default _Spotlight Search_.
* **PDFSam** for PDF operations.
* **brew** for MacOS package management.
