# Tools I Currently Use

These are my tools I have in daily (academic) usage.
I mostly try to use native applications because of their nice synchronziation across all other devices.

**Note Taking**
* **Apple Notes** for all quick notes
* **GoodNotes**: For more complex projects.
* **Obsidian** has the markdown, latex and code highlighting features I am missing in _Apple Notes_.

**News and Literture Research**
* **Zotero** incl. WebDAV file synch to private **Nextcloud** and _Zotero Cloud_ and **Chrome Connector**. Also very nice for reading papers.
* **Google Scholar Plugin** for Chrome because of nice reference previews.
* **NetNewsWire**: Nice RSS Feed Reader with iCloud synch. Really helps to stay up-to-date in all different areas of interest. RSS feeds even exist for daily arxive submissions in chosen areas.

**Visualizations**
* **Apple Keynote** (because of native Latex support) for _presentations_ and _posters_.
* **Inkscape** for vector graphic modificiations.
* **Excalidraw** (math preview) for technical sketches preferred over tikz.
* Occasionally **TikZ**
* python + matplotlib / seaborn
* _Furthermore_: **Geogebra** for graphs, **mathcha** for even more math.

**Software Development**
* Enjoying the full **JetBrain** Suite (_IntelliJ_ (Java), _clion_ (C++), ... ).
* Code Editing via **VS Code** / vim bindings / Plugins for whatever is currently needed.
* **Proxyman** and **Postman**.

**Misc**
* Task Management \& Canban Board: **Apple Reminders**
* Mail + Calendar: **Outlook**
* websites: Mostly using **Hugo** and hosted with **Netlify** + custom **Github** commit triggers.
* Password Management: **KeePassX**, but being slowly replaced by **Apple Passwords**
* **Grammarly** for spell-and grammarchecking.
* **iTerm** + **zsh** as default terminal.
* **Raycast** as a replacement of the default _Spotlight Search_.
* **PDFSam** for PDF operations.
* **brew** for MacOS package management.
* **DocuSeal** for using digital signatures on docuemnts
